\section{Sustainable Development from a Political Perspective}
\begin{quote}
	Sustainable development enables the basic needs of all people to be met and ensures a good quality of life, everywhere in the world, both now and in the future.
\end{quote}

\paragraph{Five Principles of Sustainable Development}
\begin{itemize}
	\item People\\\textit{End poverty and hunger in all forms, and ensure dignity and equality}. Ensuring that all people can be an integral part of society, that justice prevails for all and that social tensions can be kept low
	\item Prosperity\\\textit{Ensure prosperous and fulfilling lives in harmony with nature}. Ensuring that all people are able to achieve a standard of living that meets at least their basic needs
	\item Peace\\\textit{Foster peaceful, just and inclusive societies}. Ensuring that peaceful and inclusive societies can emerge
	\item Partnership\\\textit{Implement the agenda through a solid global partnership}. Ensuring that all interests are taken into account in decision-making processes and that no one is left out or left behind
	\item Planet\\\textit{Protect our planet's natural resources and climate for future generations}. Ensuring that planetary boundaries are respected
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Integrated, Equal and Balanced}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Integrated}\\
	Only through intact natural resources an efficient economy can emerge. Only through an intact economy prosperity can be created. This prosperity can only be distributed fairly in a society based on solidarity. Political processes can be designed in such a way that natural resources are preserved in the long term
	\item \textbf{Equal}\\
	All three dimensions are of equal importance
	\item \textbf{Balanced}\\
	If equal consideration is not possible in specific contexts or in relation to specific problems, deficits in disadvantaged dimensions are to be compensated
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

Sustainable development affects almost all areas of our society. The added value of a meta-perspective like the SDG is:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Orientation\\
	Clear objectives indicate where the path should lead and how far it still has to go. They point out the need for action and urgencies, and set priorities.
	\item Policy coherence\\
	The goals are interrelated and must be solved together. The meta-strategy helps to see the connections and address them together.
\end{itemize}

\section{Fundamentals of Sustainable Development}

\begin{quote}
	\textquotedblleft If the present growth trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resource depletion continue unchanged, the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years. The most probable result will be a rather sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity.\textquotedblright
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textquotedblleft Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\textquotedblright

\subsection{Organisational Response to Environmental Demands}

\begin{quote}
	\textquotedblleft There is one and \textbf{only one social responsibility of business} -- to use its resources and engage in \textbf{activities designed to increase its profits} so long as it \textbf{stays within the rules of the game}, which is to say, engages in open and free competition \textbf{without deception or fraud}.\textquotedblright\\
	\hspace*{1em} - Milton Friedman
\end{quote}

\begin{definition}
	In sociology, an \textbf{isomorphism} is a similarity of the processes or structure of one organization to those of another, be it the result of imitation or independent development under similar constraints. There are three main types of institutional isomorphism: normative, coercive and mimetic. The development that these three types of isomorphism can also create isomorphic paradoxes that hinder such development. Specifically, these isomorphic paradoxes are related to an organization's remit, resources, accountability, and professionalization.

	\item Disclosures should represent relevant information
	\item Disclosures should be specific and complete
	\item Disclosures should be clear, balanced, and understandable
	\item Disclosures should be consistent over time
	\item Disclosures should be comparable among companies within a sector, industry, or portfolio
	\item Disclosures should be reliable, verifiable, and objective
	\item Disclosures should be provided on a timely basis

\subsubsection{Habits and Biases}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Behaviour is highly habitual
	\item Habits: learned, highly automatized, stable behavioural patterns
	\item Approx. 35.53\% of our daily behaviours are habits (e.g., food choice, mobility, household)
	\item Habits help us save cognitive effort -- automatic and unconscious, based on situational cues
	\item To replace habitual behaviours, a lot of self-control (motivation) is needed (inhibit automatic response, focus on new behaviour), which is a limited resource
	\item Strong habits and biases can render norms and information ineffective
	\item People are biased towards the present
	\item Present bias: the tendency to over-value immediate rewards at the expense of long-term intentions (to protect the environment, save energy)
	\item Limited patience: People prefer to have the reward (convenience, comfort, social approval) now, and pay for it later; 'paying' for a delayed, uncertain reward is not a very attractive deal

\subsection{Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment}
The Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment integrates three aspects
\begin{itemize}
	\item Environmental (LCA or E-LCA)
	\item Social (S-LCA)
	\item Economic (Life Cycle Costs LCC)
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation*}
	\text{LCSA} = \text{LCA} + \text{SLCA} + \text{LCC}
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{(Environmental) Life Cycle Assessment}
Systematic analysis of the environmental impacts of products throughout their entire life cycle, keyword 'cradle-to-grave'. This includes all environmental impacts during production, use phase, recycling or disposal of the product, as well as up- and downstream processes.

\paragraph{Motivation for LCA from a Corporate Perspective}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Product Analysis
	\item Product Development
	\item Product Comparison\\
	Compare different alternatives, performance in relation to competitors, selection of raw-materials, intermediate products, components and suppliers
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Areas of Application}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Environmental Management\\
	Use environmentally friendly products, processes and sustainable procurement
	\item Product Marketing\\
	Leverage positive impression of sustainability benefits, have a basis for certification with an environmentally friendly label
	\item Legislation
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{How to Optimise Environmental Performance}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Have a comprehensive, holistic, environmental view
	\item Consider a large number of environmental impacts
	\item Consider the entire life cycle
	\item Should be suitable for Corporate Management Systems
	\item Quantify environmental impacts
	\item Be practical
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ISO 14040 \& 14044: Life Cycle Assessment Framework}
\begin{figure}[tbh]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{img/iso_life_cycle_assessment}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Goal and Scope Definition}
Questions to be answered:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What is being studied?
	\item What is the aim of the study?
	\item Who is addressed?
\end{itemize}

Central terms are \textbf{functional unit} which is to what quantity or benefit the environmental impacts are related, and what performance is being compared, and \textbf{system boundaries} which is what is and what is not taken into account.

\begin{definition}
	\textbf{System boundary} is the functional unit of a product system and is a quantified description of the performance requirements that the product system fulfils. This unit should relate as much as possible to the functions of the product rather than the physical product. It has to be the same for all compared product systems.
\end{definition}

System boundaries define which parts of the life cycle and which processes belong to the analysed system. They are the interface between a product system and its environment or other product systems.

\subsubsection{Inventory Analysis}
This is a compilation of all material and energy flows of the functional unit in the defined system within the system boundaries.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{img/inventory_analysis}
	\caption{Inventory analysis contributors}
	\label{fig:inventoryanalysis}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Impact Assessment}
The goal of the impact assessment is to trace the emissions or resource requirements along their path from the source to where the effect occurs in the environment. The difficulty is to not to lose yourself in the details and to determine a final impact.

\paragraph{$\text{CO}_2$ or Carbon Footprint} Converts climate-impacting emissions into $\text{CO}_2$ equivalents according to IPCC. It neglects other, possibly more direct, environmental impacts.

\paragraph{Ecological Scarcity Method} The method compares the current environmental load (actual quantity) with the load considered permissible from a socio-political point of view (tolerance quantity). The higher the actual to tolerance ratio, the higher the eco-factor of a substance (emission, resource consumption). It is measured in environmental damage points.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{img/ecological_scarcity_method_example}
	\caption{Example of impacts considered with the environmental scarcity method.}
	\label{fig:ecologicalscarcitymethodexample}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Interpretation and Evaluation}
Critical examination of all preceding steps including the identification of parameters relevant for the result, a check of consistency and completeness and a sensitivity analysis. Ask yourself if the values are correct and their certainty, which findings can be derived, what could be relevant causes for this result, and what consequences can be drawn.

\subsection{Strengths and Limits of an LCA}
\textbf{Strengths}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Comprehensive regarding substances and their impact\\
	LCA does not focus on individual problems or substances, but tries to take into account as large a number of effects as possible.
	\item Comprehensive regarding life cycle phases of products\\
	LCA considers the entire life cycle and thus also looks "behind the scenes".
	\item Quantitative\\
	LCA quantifies the environmental impact. This allows the results to be integrated into management processes and linked to economic parameters, for example.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1em}
\noindent
\textbf{Limits}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Not all impacts are considered (for example Noise or Smell)
	\item No distinction between local and global impact
	\item Quantification can pretend accuracy, which is not given
\end{itemize}

Life cycle assessments show the environmental impacts and their relevance for a specific system. Therefore, there is no such thing as the right LCA. But there are issues for which the LCA is the most suitable method if applied and interpreted correctly. The quality criterion for a life cycle assessment is transparency and thus traceability.

\section{Circular Economy}
We need to transition to a circular economy as the rate of consumption is much greater than the regeneration of these resources.
\begin{definition}
	\textquotedblleft The circular economy is an industrial system that is restorative by design.\textquotedblright\\
	\hspace*{1em} - Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2013
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	\textquotedblleft A circular economy is an economic system aimed at eliminating waste and the continual use of resources. [...] The circular economy aims to keep products, equipment and infrastructure in use for longer, thus improving the productivity of these resources. Waste materials and energy should become input for other processes.\textquotedblright\\
	\hspace*{1em} - Geissdoerfer et al, 2017
\end{definition}

\subsection{Different Sales Models}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Product as a Service\\
	Ownership replaced by 'pay as you go' and maintenance, upgrading and replacement is handled by the company.
	\item Sale with Return Option\\
	Trade-in for newer products, older equipment is refurbished and upgraded to be sold again, or sorted into rewear, reuse, recycle
	\item Rental or Subscription Model\\
	Subscription model for baby clothing and maternity wear, outgrown clothing is returned, cleaned and redistributed to another customer
	\item Sale (Starting with End-of-Life Products/Resources)\\
	Upcycling of food waste into sustainable, protein for fish, chicken, and pets
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Coordinating Circular Value Chains through Data} Globechainis a B2B marketplace for reuse across multiple industries, like construction, hotels, offices, medical, restaurants, and retail. Organisations no longer needing assets (like furniture, equipment, or office supplies) list them on the platform, where they’re requested and collected by other companies.

\subsection{Four Types of Circular Business Model (CBM) Innovation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item CBM Transformation\\
	Modification of current business model to CBM
	\item Circular Start-up\\
	New CBM is created within company
	\item CBM Diversification\\
	Additional CBM is created in addition to continuing existing business model
	\item CBM Acquisition\\
	CBM is acquired and integrated
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Economic Potentials of Circular Business Models (CBM)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Circular Design and Business Model gives competitive advantage
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Leverage product residual values
		\item Products are your resource stock – reduce risks of volatile markets
		\item Reduce costs by 10-30\% 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Integration and monitoring of product value chain, leads to a better understanding of product utilisation, know-how and services
	\item Services lead to more intensive and long-term customer relationships
	\item Stimulates innovation -- in product design and business models
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Risks for Negative Ecological Impacts}
Circular design often, but not always, leads to a better life cycle assessment of the product and its use. Often positive due to cycling, extending, intensifying and dematerialising.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Extended product life-time for active products} (use phase)\\
	Older products with lower energy efficiency than state-of-the-art feature an optimal life time which is lower than the maximal life time (replacement may lead to lower overall impacts)
	\item \textbf{New materials}\\
	Trade-offs between recyclability of materials and environmental impact during production, transport, use, etc.
	\item \textbf{New technologies}\\
	New technologies can, in addition to optimizing an environmentally relevant dimension have new negative effects
	\item \textbf{Rebound effects}\\
	Reduced prices (or increase simplicity) lead to increased consumption
\end{itemize}

	\label{fig:circulareconomydesignprinciples}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Emotional Attachment}\\
	\textbf{Interaction} You know everything about your thing -- become an expert, \textbf{Positive association} Your reminded of something you
	love, Fan culture, positive memories, \textbf{Meaningful Product} I support a cause; I am a part of something bigger, Encourage positive change, provide sense of control, feeling of changing something
	\item \textbf{Resource Efficiency}\\
	\textbf{Optimise} Reduce the size -- reduces the number of materials needed, use everything, \textbf{Secondary materials} Source from a secondary material stream and use beneficial synergies
	\item \textbf{Longevity and Durability}\\
	\textbf{Reduce moving parts} Friction between moving parts promotes wear and tear, \textbf{Ageing} Materials change with time, plan ahead, use materials that allow a graceful ageing of your product
	\item \textbf{Service and Repairability}\\
	\textbf{Easy exchange of parts} Provide easy access to fasteners and highlight them, \textbf{Let the users repair} Repairing can be fun and increases product attachment, make it easy
	\item \textbf{Modularity}\\
	\textbf{Reverse Logistics} Every part or material should return to you, establish incentives for customers to return goods, use modules for optimized transport size, \textbf{Compatibility}
	Standardisation, use the same fastening principles in every product generation, \textbf{Allow upgrades} Requirements change over time, allow easy upgrading through standardisation of the components you are using
	\item \textbf{End of Life Phase}\\
	\textbf{Avoid composite materials, Inlays and permanent joining} Separation of materials is vital for recycling, recycling has to be economically viable as it is in competition with incineration and landfills, \textbf{Collect spare parts} Some parts life longer than others
\end{itemize}

\section{Industrial Ecology (IE)}
Industrial ecology is the study of material and energy flows through industrial systems. It is concerned with the impacts that industrial activities have on the environment, with use of the planet's supply of natural resources, and with problems of waste disposal. This field approaches issues of sustainability by examining problems from multiple perspectives, usually involving aspects of sociology, the environment, economy, and technology.

\vspace*{1em}
\noindent
\textbf{Perspectives and Tools}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Life cycle thinking, complete value chains
	\item Combination of services, capital flows, material flows, and energy flows
	\item Material cycles, industrial symbioses
\end{itemize}

\section{Sustainability Strategy}
Which aspect of Sustainability is most important to focus on?
\begin{itemize}
	\item Values, Vision, Mission towards sustainable development
	\item Commitment of top management
	\item Knowledge of impacts
	\item Knowledge of stakeholder expectations
	\item Sustainability strategy
	\item Sustainability programme
	\item Reporting system to measure progress
	\item Communication (to internal and external stakeholders)
	\item Management System (integrate all above into business process)
\end{itemize}

A materiality analysis is a method to identify and prioritize the issues that are
most important to an organization and its stakeholders. Process:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Identification of topics
	\item Analysis of external expectations regarding these topics\\
	regulations, competitors, financial market, NGOs, economic environment
	\item Analysis of company impact on topics\\
	industry influence, value chain levels, geographic activity
	\item Analysis of results and validation
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Environmental Management System}
The Environmental Management System (EMS) provides a systematic way of managing an organization's environmental affairs. This creates environmental buy-in from management and employees and assigns accountability and responsibility. An EMS assists with planning, controlling and monitoring policies in an organization. The EMS serves as a tool, or process, to improve environmental performance, and sets a framework for training to achieve objectives and desired performance. It focuses on continual improvement of the system and a way to implement policies and objectives to meet a desired result. This also helps with reviewing and auditing the EMS to find future opportunities.
