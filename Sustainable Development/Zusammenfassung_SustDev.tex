\section{Sustainable Development from a Political Perspective}
\begin{quote}
	Sustainable development enables the basic needs of all people to be met and ensures a good quality of life, everywhere in the world, both now and in the future.
\end{quote}

\paragraph{Five Principles of Sustainable Development}
\begin{itemize}
	\item People\\\textit{End poverty and hunger in all forms, and ensure dignity and equality}. Ensuring that all people can be an integral part of society, that justice prevails for all and that social tensions can be kept low
	\item Prosperity\\\textit{Ensure prosperous and fulfilling lives in harmony with nature}. Ensuring that all people are able to achieve a standard of living that meets at least their basic needs
	\item Peace\\\textit{Foster peaceful, just and inclusive societies}. Ensuring that peaceful and inclusive societies can emerge
	\item Partnership\\\textit{Implement the agenda through a solid global partnership}. Ensuring that all interests are taken into account in decision-making processes and that no one is left out or left behind
	\item Planet\\\textit{Protect our planet's natural resources and climate for future generations}. Ensuring that planetary boundaries are respected
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Integrated, Equal and Balanced}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Integrated}\\
	Only through intact natural resources an efficient economy can emerge. Only through an intact economy prosperity can be created. This prosperity can only be distributed fairly in a society based on solidarity. Political processes can be designed in such a way that natural resources are preserved in the long term
	\item \textbf{Equal}\\
	All three dimensions are of equal importance
	\item \textbf{Balanced}\\
	If equal consideration is not possible in specific contexts or in relation to specific problems, deficits in disadvantaged dimensions are to be compensated
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

Sustainable development affects almost all areas of our society. The added value of a meta-perspective like the SDG is:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Orientation\\
	Clear objectives indicate where the path should lead and how far it still has to go. They point out the need for action and urgencies, and set priorities.
	\item Policy coherence\\
	The goals are interrelated and must be solved together. The meta-strategy helps to see the connections and address them together.
\end{itemize}

\section{Fundamentals of Sustainable Development}

\begin{quote}
	\textquotedblleft If the present growth trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resource depletion continue unchanged, the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years. The most probable result will be a rather sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity.\textquotedblright
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textquotedblleft Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\textquotedblright

\subsection{International Debate}

\subsubsection{Six Core Functions of International Conferences on Sustainable Development}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item \textbf{Setting Global Agendas}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Providing a relatively open space in which states, international organizations, and NGOs can meet to plan the future trajectory of sustainable development
		\item Addressing, discussing and resolving global issues of sustainable development
		\item Creating and increasing political, media and public attention
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{'Joining up' Problems}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Bringing together debates on global long-term issues that are often dealt with in a disconnected and ad hoc manner (e.g., poverty, inequality, environmental protection, development priorities)
		\item Addressing the contradictions between the different target dimensions by developing and promoting integrative concepts
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Endorsing Common Principles}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Signing of (binding) agreements and resolutions that provide guidelines, recommendations and standards
		\item "Soft law" that in time, hopefully, will become "hard law"
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Providing Leadership}
	\begin{itemize}

	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development}
Signed by all 193 UN member countries with the overarching aim for a fundamental social, economic and environmental transformation. This resolution is not legally binding and only a declaration of intent. There are contradictory goals, promote economic and social development while reducing the impact on the environment at the same time. And scientific and technological innovation is seen as a key enabler of sustainable development. Monitoring and reviewing of target achievement based on a set of indicators on global and national level.

\subsubsection{Habits and Biases}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Behaviour is highly habitual
	\item Habits: learned, highly automatized, stable behavioural patterns
	\item Approx. 35.53\% of our daily behaviours are habits (e.g., food choice, mobility, household)
	\item Habits help us save cognitive effort -- automatic and unconscious, based on situational cues
	\item To replace habitual behaviours, a lot of self-control (motivation) is needed (inhibit automatic response, focus on new behaviour), which is a limited resource
	\item Strong habits and biases can render norms and information ineffective
	\item People are biased towards the present
	\item Present bias: the tendency to over-value immediate rewards at the expense of long-term intentions (to protect the environment, save energy)
	\item Limited patience: People prefer to have the reward (convenience, comfort, social approval) now, and pay for it later; 'paying' for a delayed, uncertain reward is not a very attractive deal
\end{itemize}
